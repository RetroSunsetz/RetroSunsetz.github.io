    <p id="about"><span id="rr">"</span>Hi there, I'm Khaled, your friendly neighborhood red teamer and penetration tester.

I'm the guy who gets paid to break into companies, but don't worry - I'm on your side! Think of me as a digital superhero, swooping in to save the day by identifying and neutralizing cyber threats. When I'm not busy hacking away, you can find me exploring new ways to outsmart the bad guys and keep your data safe.

Over the years, I have honed my skills and worked hard to become an expert in my field. In 2022, I received my first certification, the eJPT, which solidified my knowledge of the basics of penetration testing.

I believe in the importance of maintaining a strong work ethic, taking responsibility for my actions, and operating with integrity and professionalism in all that I do. These values have helped me build a successful career in cybersecurity and have earned me the trust and respect of my clients and colleagues.

        Thank you for taking the time to visit my site, and I look forward to connecting with you anytime!<span id="rr">"</span></p>
